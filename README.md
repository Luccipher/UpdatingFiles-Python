# UpdatingFiles-Python
Project description
In this lab, we showcase the utilization of the open() function and the with statement in Python for handling file operations. The focus is on reading data from text files and writing data to them.

Open the file that contains the allow list-
To begin with the algorithm, I accessed the file named "allow_list.txt". Initially, I stored the name of this file as a string in the variable named "import_file":  # Assign `import_file` to the name of the file
import_file= "allow_list.txt"
Then I used a with statement to open the file: # Build `with` statement to read in the initial contwnts of the file
with open(import_file, "r:) as file:

I utilize the with statement and the .open() function in read mode to open my algorithm's allow list file. The purpose of this action is to gain access to the IP addresses stored within the file. By employing the with keyword, I can effectively manage resources by automatically closing the file upon exiting the with statement. The code segment "with open(import_file, "r") as file:" demonstrates the usage of the open() function with two parameters. The first parameter specifies the file to be imported, while the second parameter indicates the desired action, which in this case is to read the file. Additionally, the as keyword assigns the variable "file" to store the output of the .open() function, facilitating further operations within the with statement.
